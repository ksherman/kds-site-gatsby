Why the web and digital matters to higher education</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We take the web for granted.</li>\n<li>University of Nebraska - 1.2 million visitors in a month (over 7M pageviews)</li>\n<li>149,512 - the hours spent on the university\'s website in one month.</li>\n<li>What would happen if your website disappeared tomorrow? Could your campus still function?</li>\n<li>What will change? _ The move from atoms to bits _ Being Digital (book) _ Everything that can become digital will become digital _ The digital campus (teaching with technology) _ What is the location of your campus? Not too long from now, the website will be the "location" of the campus. _ Higher education is getting flattened _ Tom Friedman\'s book "The World is Flat"; technology can make some industries obsolete. _ Higher education is not likely to be obsolete, but I could become unrecognizable. _ Deferred maintenance: the campuses are crumbling. _ Digital is an opportunity to do things much more efficiently to improve our business models - The coming of the iGeneration: Student expectations are going to grow exponentially.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. What we are doing wrong</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tremendous progress, but still a long way to go.</li>\n<li>Mark\'s blog post <a href="http://www.markgr.com/most-college-web-sites-are-bad/">"True of False: Most College Web Sites Are Bad"</a></li>\n<li>Hubris: stick your head in the sand and don\'t think anything bad could happen. We are not too big to fail</li>\n<li>Unique organizational structures and politics: it is in your best interest to understand how these structures work.</li>\n<li>Over reliance on consensus decision making: with technology changing at exponential rates, it takes too long and often results in compromise.</li>\n<li>Smashing Magazine - <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/why-design-by-commitee-should-die/">"Why Design By Committee Should Die"</a></li>\n<li>Decisions are made on power, rather than expertise. Perhaps more prevalent in Higher Ed than most other verticals.</li>\n<li>Hick\'s Law- The time it takes for a person to make a decision as a reult of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision making time exponentially.</li>\n<li>Everytime you add an element to a webpage, every other element on the page is less importance.</li>\n<li>The Web is Not a Project: a project has an ending.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. How we can fix it.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace your internal digital experts</li>\n<li>Everyone should know what you don\'t know</li>\n<li>Replace consensus decision making with RACI Matrix _ R: Responsible- for performing the work _ A: Accountable- for the final decision making authority _ C: Consulted- will provide information and feedback _ I: Informed- who are kept informed</li>\n<li>Work closer with each other. "Managing Chaos"</li>\n<li>Embrace the Post Launch Paradigm: once your whatever goes live, that is when the real work begins.</li>\n<li>Is it asking too much for an institution of higher learning not to have spelling errors? It is a business risk, studies show some people will ch</li>\n<li>Is your website better today than it was yesterday?</li>\n<li>Practice Good strategy, eliminate bad strategy "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"</li>\n<li>Actionable steps to leverage strengths to meet challenges</li>\n<li>Holistic edu web site: intersection of Academics, MarCom, and Services.</li>\n<li>Focus on value and return on investment: as you think about the work you are doing, are you actually working to solve problems?</li>\n<li>User experience should be a priority</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button">The $300 Million Dollar Button</a></li>\n<li>For many people, the process of visiting a college is still a challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How good is good enough?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What keeps your college president up at night?</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.maguireassoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-PresidentsReport_Chron-Maguire-2.pdf">The View From the Top</a>: the web can help address every one of these points.</li>\n<li>"Time to start Thinking": Higher education used to be a public good, to build an educated workforce. Today, the focus is all personal, for me to get a better job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Working in Higher Education</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your graduation ceremonies!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Peace<br>-- KS<br>Web Developer at Benedictine University near Chicago</p>',frontmatter:{title:"The .edu Manifesto",author:"Kevin D.
