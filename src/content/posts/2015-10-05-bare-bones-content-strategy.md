* We should plan for simple.
* Content strategy is simple. 
* But content is complex. Content is confusing. Content is time-consuming.
* Complexity is often the problem (solving complex problems with complex solutions, but that is hard to sustain.)

### Plan for Simple
* Simple means that tasks are easily understood and done. 
* Not getting bogged down in difficult processes. 
* Understand the complexity we want to solve. It is hard to simplify if you don't understand the goals.
* Conduct stakeholder interviews
	* schedule, listen and guide, decide what to ask. 
	* purpose is to help define broad goals. 
	* identify the themes and shared goals.
	* Learn the purpose and value of their content.
* Understand the details
* defining Content Goals, Examples:
	* Provide new student information, resources, encourage engagement. 
	* Describe the distinguishing characteristic of the academic program
	* Inform Current Students about course scheduling and policies
* Messaging Guidelines Examples
	* Transformative
		* Service Oriented, passionate, collaborative (define the jargon!)
	* Community Building
	* Valuable
	* Vibrant

	* Page templates, Content Audits, Calendars, Schedules, Taxonomy, etc.

#### In the end, the best content strategy is the one that works for you.

* Talk results, not content. 
* Don't talk about the process up-front.
* If content strategy is working, it makes building content easier for everyone. 
* Speak human, use plain language. "I make sure the content is useful for the people who need it."
* Help people understand how content strategy will help them.
