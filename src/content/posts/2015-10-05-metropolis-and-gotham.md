Whew, I don't have the stats on here, but man what a HUGE project. Like Donald Trump HUGE. 

These are notes from a talk by [Jeff Stevens](https://twitter.com/kuratowa) titled "Metropolis and Gotham, A Tale of Two Cities: Two Different Approaches to Enterprise Site Development" during the HighEdWeb 2015. University of Florida Health

* Two major projects: UFHealth.org (External Facing) & Bridge (Intranet)

### UFHealth.org [Metropolis]
* Unify Web Properties
* Focus on Patients
* Change starts at the top
* ... and then from deep within the organization
* Senior Leadership must be able to recognize positive change, empower it, and embrace process and goals. 
* Committees are vital.
	* Champions of the goals, expertise, and process.
	* Choose people by expertise and skills over position. 
	* Choose people that will help, not hinder. 
* Smart shared governance
* Elevate Innovation
* CMS Selection Committee
* Select a team.
* Design Committee (presented as if they were agencies)
* Information Architecture Committee
* Content and Governance Committee
* After those committees were finished, they were reformed into smaller working groups. 
* 80/20 rule, 20% of the people in the committees did 80% of the work and were chosen for the working group. 
* Web team served as consultants than as leaders of the committees, and served as the secretaries. 
* Show your work (tiered unveiling and iterative change)
* Training on the new systems, lectures, emails, blogs, and 1 on 1
* Lot of positive improvements in metrics (pageviews/patient appointments, etc.)

##### Rogues Gallery
* Silos and Holdouts: Left them alone; eventually senior leadership applied the pressure. 
* Provided more Services/Support
* Compromise
* Time: Migration time was limited, but was mitigated by training. 
* Uniformity: stadard template, developed enough configurable options into the templates eventually. Vetted plugins


### UF Bridge
* Unify Intranets
* News and Team Building
* Because of the success of the UFHealth team, they were given the intranet project. 
* Built it on WordPress (BuddyPress)
* Building a team: Existing team + an additional content coordinator
* Do deep research: Nielsen Intranet Report, Interviews, Card Sorts
* Did much of the process along. 
* Mitigating Annxiety: build buy-in
* Development took 18 months, 9 months to migrate. 

##### Rouges Gallery
* Content and Governance: Content Audits; Training; New Structures and Procedures
* Compliance
* Team Burnout: since no one "cares" about the intranet...; more team building events; more communication from Senior Leadership; scope reduction
* Information Architecture: Dynamic Site vs Quicklinks; Card Sorting and Curated Links
* Tech Issues: Servers, On the Floor Interfaces; Solutions; Be agile; have teams ready
* External sites: weren't able to do as much for the external sites during the project. 
* The Unexpected

### Hybrid Approach
* Magazine Theme: Second external facing theme that is for the magazines. 
* UF Health Directory: Ties in academic and patient areas for a unified directory. 
* UF Style Changes
* SPEED
* Both have the same goal: to help people. Make mistakes, better.
