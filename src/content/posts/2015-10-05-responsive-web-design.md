* To serve our users better, presenting them with the content they need, when they need it, where they need it.
* RRWD: Responsible
* Keep it Real, Content is real
* Tips, Tricks
	* Images: max-width: 100%; height: auto; Quality: 60%, 100-150K max; Image optimizer (kraken.io) or media queries to server different images. 
	* Video: Let a third party do it!
	* BAckground Video, preload=none; Network Information API to adjust qualty based on network information, on scroll down stop loading video
