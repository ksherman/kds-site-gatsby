## The goal is to theoretically never have to do this again 

### Before You Start
* Have a good reason. Must be more than you're bored. 
	* Business needs have changed?
	* The site is not meeting goals and objectives
	* Incorporate rebranding. 
	* External technology had changed (mobile)
	* Develop Your Web Strategy
		* Not just setting goals
		* Actionable steps to leverage strengths to meet challenges.
		* True strategy identifies the biggest challendes to forward progress and a cohesive approach
		* Leverage Institutional Strength
		* Being ambitious is not a strategy
		* Over come obstacles, not just desires. 
		* Strategies need to address unique challenges. 
		* Why do you have a website. (first and foremost for prospects) 
		* Know the problem you are trying to solve. 
		* MUST align with organizational strategy.
	* Web Governance: Decide who gets to decide
	* Revisit UX and AX/a11y: If you work on your AX, you'll get an improvement to your UX
	* User-Centered Design: Design Philosophy; the end-users needs are first.
	* Find the balance between user needs and business needs.


	

### The Web Redesign Process
1. Definition and Planning
	* Redesign is nice because there is a lot of available data to work from. 
	* Web Analytics: can tell you what, but not why.
	* Deliverables: Strategic Brief, Creative Brief, Functional Brief, Project Charter.

2. Selection of a CMS
	* Know the problem you are trying to solve. 
	* Keep it as simple as possible. 
	* Create Use-case scenarios. 
	* Don't rely only on demos, try to use the tool in your own context if possible. 

3. Site Structure
	* Content: audit, inventory, and content creation
	* Information Architecture.
	* Think task-onomy rather than taxonomy
	* Navigation should always move visitors towards their goals.
	* Keep structure close to existing as possible. 
	* Address content early in the project
	* Deliverables: Site Blueprints, Wireframes, Card sorting, task flow analysis, personas and journey maps, usability testing.
	* Your goal is to get people to their task as quickly as possible.

4. Visual Design
	* Translate blueprints and wireframes into design comps based on the creative brief. 
	* Design is an iterative process
	* Visual design decisions can be the most contentious. 
	* Let the designers design, know what you don't know!
	* 5 second test

5. Site Development
	* Development/Beta site
	* Templates are created, then pages are created and populated. 
	* Validation early
	* Content migration

6. Testing
	* Not design testing
	* Iterative testing
	* Technical testing (HTML, js, css, etc.)

7. Launch and Post Launch Analysis


### Thinking about Post Launch
* The web is not a project; project work vs operational work.
* Automated testing is useful.
* 74% of consumers pay attention to spelling and grammar. 59% said they would avoid doing business.
* Plan beyond the launch. Identify resources for support at the start of any project. If resources aren't available, scale back the project. 
* Keep it simple from the start. 
* Think re-align instead of redesign.
* Iterative change is better than the cycle. 
* Maintain the momentum after the project is complete. 
* Formalize your Web Operations
	* Use automated tool to monitor the ongoing quality of the site. 
	* A system to manage daily web operations. 
	* Set of reports that track the quality over time.
