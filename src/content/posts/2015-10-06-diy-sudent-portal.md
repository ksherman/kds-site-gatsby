### The Problem

* had trouble keeping track of students
* disjointed systems for students
* Too many passwords across campus.
* hard to find services.
* biggest target was at-risk students; didn't have a way to help them along except through their professors.

### The Solution

* A way for students could access resources and services through one system.
* One login, then could jump off to other services.
* Used MS's login page, then used some magic to also log into their new portal.
* Created "Ads" to help expose available services.
