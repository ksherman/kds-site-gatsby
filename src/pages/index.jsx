    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Kevin Sherman, a full-stack developer with a particular passion for front-end javascript frameworks. I love working in VueJS, but have also shipped code in React, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Angular, and NodeJS. In 2015 I completed an MBA, and after working in higher education for almost 10 years, I left to joing a start-up building the front-end of a web application serving the concrete/construction industry.</p>

    <p>I have just started this space back up, most of the content is a bit old but I want this to be a space for my notes on things I'm learning, am interested in, or other thoughts someone somewhere might be interested in reading!</p>

    <p>You can connect with me on <a className="link" href="https://twitter.com/kd_sherm" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, learn more about my experience on <a className="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kdsherm/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or <a className="link" href="mailto:kevin@kdshermphoto.com">send me an email</a>!</p>
