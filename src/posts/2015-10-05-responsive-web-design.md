* Our goal in life is to server others. 
* Reach visitors where they're at. 
* Seamless experience across devices. 
* Mobile first: forces you to think about the smallest use case first. Helps with content priority and content flow. 
* To serve our users better, presenting them with the content they need, when they need it, where they need it.
* RRWD: Responsible
* Keep it Real, Content is real
* Tips, Tricks
	* Images: max-width: 100%; height: auto; Quality: 60%, 100-150K max; Image optimizer (kraken.io) or media queries to server different images. 
	* Video: Let a third party do it!
	* BAckground Video, preload=none; Network Information API to adjust qualty based on network information, on scroll down stop loading video
	* Carousel: Rethink usage
	* Accordions: useful
	* In-page navigation: smooth scroll instead of jumping to anchors
	* RWD + CMS: CMS templates can help move people along
