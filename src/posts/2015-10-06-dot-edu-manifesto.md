We've made a lot of progress, but still have more to do.

### 1. Why the web and digital matters to higher education

* We take the web for granted.
* University of Nebraska - 1.2 million visitors in a month (over 7M pageviews)
* 149,512 - the hours spent on the university's website in one month.
* What would happen if your website disappeared tomorrow? Could your campus still function?
* What will change? _ The move from atoms to bits _ Being Digital (book) _ Everything that can become digital will become digital _ The digital campus (teaching with technology) _ What is the location of your campus? Not too long from now, the website will be the "location" of the campus. _ Higher education is getting flattened _ Tom Friedman's book "The World is Flat"; technology can make some industries obsolete. _ Higher education is not likely to be obsolete, but I could become unrecognizable. _ Deferred maintenance: the campuses are crumbling. _ Digital is an opportunity to do things much more efficiently to improve our business models - The coming of the iGeneration: Student expectations are going to grow exponentially.

### 2. What we are doing wrong

* Tremendous progress, but still a long way to go.
* Mark's blog post ["True of False: Most College Web Sites Are Bad"](http://www.markgr.com/most-college-web-sites-are-bad/)
* Hubris: stick your head in the sand and don't think anything bad could happen. We are not too big to fail
* Unique organizational structures and politics: it is in your best interest to understand how these structures work.
* Over reliance on consensus decision making: with technology changing at exponential rates, it takes too long and often results in compromise.
* Smashing Magazine - ["Why Design By Committee Should Die"](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/why-design-by-commitee-should-die/)
* Decisions are made on power, rather than expertise. Perhaps more prevalent in Higher Ed than most other verticals.
* Hick's Law- The time it takes for a person to make a decision as a reult of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision making time exponentially.
* Everytime you add an element to a webpage, every other element on the page is less importance.
* The Web is Not a Project: a project has an ending.

### 3. How we can fix it.

* Embrace your internal digital experts
* Everyone should know what you don't know
* Replace consensus decision making with RACI Matrix _ R: Responsible- for performing the work _ A: Accountable- for the final decision making authority _ C: Consulted- will provide information and feedback _ I: Informed- who are kept informed
* Work closer with each other. "Managing Chaos"
* Embrace the Post Launch Paradigm: once your whatever goes live, that is when the real work begins.
* Is it asking too much for an institution of higher learning not to have spelling errors? It is a business risk, studies show some people will ch
* Is your website better today than it was yesterday?
* Practice Good strategy, eliminate bad strategy "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"
* Actionable steps to leverage strengths to meet challenges
* Holistic edu web site: intersection of Academics, MarCom, and Services.
* Focus on value and return on investment: as you think about the work you are doing, are you actually working to solve problems?
* User experience should be a priority
* [The $300 Million Dollar Button](https://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button)
* For many people, the process of visiting a college is still a challenge.

### How good is good enough?

* What keeps your college president up at night?
* [The View From the Top](http://www.maguireassoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-PresidentsReport_Chron-Maguire-2.pdf): the web can help address every one of these points.
* "Time to start Thinking": Higher education used to be a public good, to build an educated workforce. Today, the focus is all personal, for me to get a better job.

### Working in Higher Education

* Go to your graduation ceremonies!
