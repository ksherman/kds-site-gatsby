### The Project

* Weekly meet ups
* Version Control - Git
* Gitlab Issues
* Pull Requests and Code Reviews
* Accessibility: Bootstrap (sr-only classes) + ngAria (AngularJS library)
* Student Feedback _ Very positive response _ 20 person user groups \* Used the survey to iterate and improve.
* Other Uses _ Recruitment Tools (could show prospects the courses they offered) _ Each campus wants their own unique search.
* Challenges: _ Relevance or Course Number? _ Dropdowns? _ Why isn't my course first? _ Let the data speak - use analytics, not your opinion. \* Not yet launched
