### Issues on the old way 
* Data structure changes = downstream impact
* Direct load to data layer
* No insight into usage / frequency
* Less secure
* Less efficient
* Many consumers of data, many security process, lots of data

* WSO2 is the open source tool (there are several options)


### Data Services Server
* Access to all data stores
* Turn a SQL Query into an API
* Eliminated the need for direct DB Access

### Enterprise Service Bus
* Contral hub for all web services
* Control access to the resource level
